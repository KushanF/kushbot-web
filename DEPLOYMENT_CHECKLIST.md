## 🚨 Critical: Fix Build Error BEFORE Deployment

### Node.js Version Issue
Your system is running **Node.js v14.17.3**, which is too old and causes the build to fail.

**Solution:** Upgrade to Node.js v16 or higher

```bash
# Option 1: Using nvm (recommended)
nvm install 18
nvm use 18

# Option 2: Download from nodejs.org
# Visit https://nodejs.org and download Node.js 18 LTS

# Verify installation
node --version  # Should show v18.x.x or higher
```

After upgrading Node.js:
```bash
npm install  # Reinstall dependencies
npm run build  # Test production build
```

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Upgrade Node.js to v16+ (currently v14.17.3)
- [ ] Run `npm install` after Node upgrade
- [ ] Run `npm run build` successfully
- [ ] Run `npm test` to verify all tests pass
- [ ] Test all routes in development:
  - [ ] Home page (`/`)
  - [ ] Bonus Buy page (`/bonus-buy`)
  - [ ] Summit page (`/summit`)
  - [ ] Monthly Promo Plan page (`/monthly-promo-plan`)
- [ ] Verify file upload validation works
- [ ] Test error messages display correctly
- [ ] Verify loading spinner shows during upload
- [ ] Check Lambda endpoints are accessible from production domain

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel

```

### Option 2: Netlify
```bash
npm run build
# Drag and drop the `build/` folder to Netlify
```

### Option 3: AWS S3 + CloudFront
```bash
npm run build
aws s3 sync build/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete
```

## 📝 Post-Deployment

- [ ] Verify production URL loads correctly
- [ ] Test all file upload flows in production
